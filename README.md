## 📌 Overview

**HI Buddy** is an AI-powered fitness planning web application designed especially for **students** and beginners who struggle with generic workout and diet plans.

Most existing fitness apps:
- Provide **one-size-fits-all** routines  
- Ignore **regional food habits**
- Don’t consider **budget constraints**
- Assume access to **premium gym equipment**

**HI Buddy solves this problem** by generating **personalized, practical, and budget-friendly workout & nutrition plans** based on individual user data.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students require a fitness system that:
- Adapts to **personal body metrics**
- Respects **cultural and regional food preferences**
- Works with **available resources** (home or gym)
- Fits within a **student-friendly budget**

Generic fitness plans fail to meet these real-world constraints.

## 💡 Solution

**HI Buddy** uses AI-driven logic to:
- Analyze user inputs (age, weight, height, goals, time, equipment)
- Personalize workout routines
- Generate diet plans aligned with **Indian food habits**
- Optimize plans for **effectiveness, affordability, and sustainability**
